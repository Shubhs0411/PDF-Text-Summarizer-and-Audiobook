    "GPT-2 was created as a direct scale-up of GPT, with both its parameter count and dataset size increased by a factor of 10.[7][9][8] Both are unsupervised transformer models trained to generate text by predicting the next word in a sequence of tokens. The GPT-2 model has 1.5 billion parameters, and was trained on a dataset of 8 million web pages.[7] While its objective is simple (interpreting a sequence of words in a text sample and predicting the most likely next word), GPT-2 can produce full sentences and paragraphs by continuing to predict additional words, which constitute fully comprehensible (and semantically meaningful) statements in natural language.[7]\n",
