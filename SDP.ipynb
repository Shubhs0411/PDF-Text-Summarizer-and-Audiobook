In this paper, it is argued that autoformalization is a promising path for systems to learn sophisticated, general purpose reasoning in all domains of mathematics and computer science. This could have far reaching implications not just for mathemat- ical research, but also for software synthesis. Here I provide the outline for a realistic path towards those goals and give a survey of recent results that support the feasibility of this direction.\r\n",

        " Today, AI systems are able to learn solving tasks that used to be thought of taking uniquely human capabilities until recently: computer vision [16], gener- ating artistic images [13], music [21], mastering the game of go [13], discovering novel drugs [15] and performing symbolic integration (31), to name just a few.\r\n",
        " These and many other domains seemed to require uniquely human intuition and insight, but were transformed by deep learning in the past few years. While progress has been extremely impressive in those areas, each particular solution addresses a relatively narrow use case. On the other hand, general reasoning still seems a uniquely human feat and many [20] would argue that creating Al agents with general reasoning capabilities equaling to those of humans would take decades, maybe centuries, if possible at all.\r\n",
        " \r\n",

        " the correctness or resource use of a computer program or to derive the conse- quences of a physical model, it is all mathematical reasoning, as long as it is based on fully formalized premises and transformation rules. Some tasks may require such a large number of logical steps that humans find it impossible to check them manually, but often they are easily solved by SAT-solvers [5] - pro- grams whose sole goal is to decide if a Boolean expression can ever evaluate to true.\r\n",
        " \r\n",
        " For certain classes of expressions, like those that occur frequently in chip design, SAT solvers work remarkably well [10]. An extreme demonstration of their power is their use in the computer generated proof of a previously unsolved famous conjecture in mathematics [25] ~ the Boolean Pythagorean triples prob- lem. The final proof was 200 terabytes long.\r\n",
        " \r\n",
        " However, SAT-solvers cannot verify statements about infinitely many cases.\r\n",
        " For example, they can't even verify that the addition of integer numbers is com- mutative. There are automated theorem provers (ATPs [L1]) for finding moder- ately difficult proofs in first order logic that can deal with such problems. Proof automation via \"hammers\" (6,27) is also applied for higher order logic as well in the context of interactive theorem proving. Most existing proof automation is based on hand engineered heuristics, not on machine learning and is not capable of open-ended self-improvement.\r\n",

        " Reasoning about anything formal could be a powerful general tool. If we want to create an artificially intelligent system and demonstrate its general intelligence, it should be able to reason about any area of mathematics or at least it should be able to learn to do so given enough time. If it succeeds in practice, then we can be convinced that it is likely that it will be able to learn to cope with any scientific discipline as far as it can be formalized precisely.\r\n",

Human mathematicians spend years studying just to become experts in a few of those domains. An artificial system engineered to produce strong results in a particular area is not a \"general purpose\" reasoning engine. However, if a system demon- strates that it can learn to reason in any area it is exposed to, then that would be a convincing demonstration of artificial general intelligence.\r\n",
